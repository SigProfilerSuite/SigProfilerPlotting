## Running the Example Program ##
After you have successfully installed SigProfilerPlotting, [download SigProfilerPlottingExampleProgram.zip][1], and move it to your desktop and unzip it.

Next, open up your application terminal and enter the following command:

    cd ~/Desktop/SigProfilerPlottingExampleProgram/
    
You can now run the example program by entering the command:

    python3 plot_example.py
    
It may take a few seconds to complete. You can find the output graphs in the directory labeled `plots`, which is located in your current directory. If you are having difficulty locating the folder, open the finder application and press `⌘ + Shift + G` and enter into the "Go to the Folder" drop down menu: `~/Desktop/SigProfilerPlottingExampleProgram/plots/`

If you delete the four plot files and run plot_example.py then they should be generated again.

Now that you were able to run `plot_example.py` your environment is set up and you are ready to start writing your own applications. Take a look at the sections labeled [Plotting Substitutions][2], [Plotting Indels][3], and [Plotting Dinucleotides][4] for more details about the different functions that SigProfilerPlotting provides.
