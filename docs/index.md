# SigProfilerPlotting #
----------

SigProfilerPlotting provides a standard tool for displaying all types of mutational signatures as well as all types of mutational patterns in cancer genomes. The tool seamlessly integrates with other SigProfiler tools.

The SigProfilerPlotting library can be found on github [here][2].
The [README.md][3] file provides a great overview if you already have python and pip installed on your computer. For users that prefer working in an R environment, we provide an R wrapper (SigProfilerPlottingR) that can be found on github [here][12].
